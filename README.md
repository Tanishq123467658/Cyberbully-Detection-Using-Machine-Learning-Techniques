## Overview

Cyberbullying on social platforms has serious emotional and psychological impacts. This repository uses machine learning to detect abusive tweets, helping to flag harmful content automatically.

---

## Features

- âœ… Data preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization  
- âœ… Feature extraction through TF-IDF  
- âœ… Model training and performance analysis (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)  
- âœ… Intuitive visualizations of metrics and confusion matrices

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanishq123467658/Cyberbully-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques.git
   cd Cyberbully-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Place `cyberbullying_tweets.csv` in the root directory (already included).
2. Run the full pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. View generated plots in `results/` and models in `models/`.

**Optional:** Customize preprocessing options or model hyperparameters by editing relevant scripts.

---

## Model & Data

- **Dataset:** Labeled tweets (bullying vs. non-bullying).
- **Preprocessing:** Lowercasing, punctuation stripping, stop-word removal.
- **Features:** TF-IDF vectors representing text frequency.
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, etc. capable of binary classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1â€“Score, Confusion Matrix.

---

## Results & Visualization

The pipeline produces:

- **`results/metrics.json`** â€“ Key metrics per classifier.
- **`results/confusion_matrix.png`** â€“ Confusion matrices.
- **`results/feature_importance.png`** â€“ Insights into influential terms.
- **`models/`** â€“ Saved `.pkl` model files ready for reuse.

Use **`visualization.py`** separately to regenerate visual outputs anytime.
